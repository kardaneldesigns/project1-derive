# Dérive

Visit 5 websites. For each one, document or comment on the following:
* What is the URL?
* How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?
* How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?
* Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?
* What parts of the site are interactive?
* How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?
* What is one thing you would change about this site?

Your responses may be point form, or 1–2 paragraphs about each site as long as you cover the points listed above for each.

## Site 1
* https://ca.shein.com/
* Google Search
* It's a fairly current contemporary design. Title bar at the top and big feature images within the initial viewpane. It is made up of visual boxes in order. Has popups from the side of the website about sales happening. Smaller 2 column interactive boxes that bring you to categorized merchandise. Social media and contact information in the footer.
* Navigation is familiar and user friendly. Headings and links are where you would commonly expect them to be on the page.
* Boxes throughout the pages and photos are linked to specific pages for each item and I found the experience very user friendly.
* It is very useful as I found myself floating through the site effortlessly. It is interesting because of the products but as a design I think it could be better. But the color scheme is good. A lot of white and black which allows the products to pop and be the main statement.
* I think I might change the sidebar when you are searching through products - i would make it a collapsable menu instead of a static one to give more attention to the products. Right now it takes up a lot of real estate on the page that is unnecessary.

## Site 2
* https://trypap.com/
* I searched up a website that gives me random pointless websites, clicked the button and this popped up. It passive aggressively makes fun of the passwords you input in the search bar.
* The design is pretty simple. Block colors. Its minimalistic.
* As far as navigation, its a pretty pointless site. There's only a link at the bottom for an about page, and buttons to post to social media. Besides those, the search bar that is the center of the websites purpose is quite functional.
* The password input bar, the links at the bottom of the page, and the header which opens an info box when you hover over it.
* I find it hilarious if you are looking for something pointless to do. I only randomly came across it. It's interesting in a way because the passive aggressive responses are random and make you laugh.
* Not sure what you can do to improve a site that is meant to be pointless, but you could probably add a nice title, and maybe upgrade it to a site with a small menu with other activity options if you wanted to make it more usable.
