## Site 1
* https://ca.shein.com/
* Google Search
* It's a fairly current contemporary design. Title bar at the top and big feature images within the initial viewpane. It is made up of visual boxes in order. Has popups from the side of the website about sales happening. Smaller 2 column interactive boxes that bring you to categorized merchandise. Social media and contact information in the footer.
* Navigation is familiar and user friendly. Headings and links are where you would commonly expect them to be on the page.
* Boxes throughout the pages and photos are linked to specific pages for each item and I found the experience very user friendly.
* It is very usefull as I found myself floating through the site effortlessly. It is interesting because of the products but as a design I think it could be better. But the color scheme is good. A lot of white and black which allows the products to pop and be the main statement.
* I think I might change the sidebar when you are searching through products - i would make it a collapseable menu instead of a static one to give more attention to the products. Right now it takes up a lot of realestate on the page that is unnecessary.
