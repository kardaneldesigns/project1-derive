Your responses may be point form, or 1–2 paragraphs about each site as long as you cover the points listed above for each.

## Site 1
* https://ca.shein.com/
* Google Search
* It's a fairly current contemporary design. Title bar at the top and big feature images within the initial viewpane. It is made up of visual boxes in order. Has popups from the side of the website about sales happening. Smaller 2 column interactive boxes that bring you to categorized merchandise. Social media and contact information in the footer.
* Navigation is familiar and user friendly. Headings and links are where you would commonly expect them to be on the page.
* Boxes throughout the pages and photos are linked to specific pages for each item and I found the experience very user friendly.
* It is very useful as I found myself floating through the site effortlessly. It is interesting because of the products but as a design I think it could be better. But the color scheme is good. A lot of white and black which allows the products to pop and be the main statement.
* I think I might change the sidebar when you are searching through products - i would make it a collapsable menu instead of a static one to give more attention to the products. Right now it takes up a lot of real estate on the page that is unnecessary.

## Site 2
* https://trypap.com/
* I searched up a website that gives me random pointless websites, clicked the button and this popped up. It passive aggressively makes fun of the passwords you input in the search bar.
* The design is pretty simple. Block colors. Its minimalistic.
* As far as navigation, its a pretty pointless site. There's only a link at the bottom for an about page, and buttons to post to social media. Besides those, the search bar that is the center of the websites purpose is quite functional.
* The password input bar, the links at the bottom of the page, and the header which opens an info box when you hover over it.
* I find it hilarious if you are looking for something pointless to do. I only randomly came across it. It's interesting in a way because the passive aggressive responses are random and make you laugh.
* Not sure what you can do to improve a site that is meant to be pointless, but you could probably add a nice title, and maybe upgrade it to a site with a small menu with other activity options if you wanted to make it more usable.

## Site 3
* https://bethelmusic.com/
* I followed a link from a youtube video i was watching.
* The design is very current and modern. They have gotten creative with the layout of the main page. There are a bunch of overlapping elements and well designed layouts that are interesting to the eye. They have a "featured" hero image at the top with the latest album that is to be released.
* The navigation is pretty familiar while still giving interest. There is a hamburger menu on the far right top corner, and the other menu headings are all placed within the right quarter of the top of the screen - they don't span across the whole top. And there is a link back to the home page with the website name in the top left corner. They are easy to use and bring you right to a page you would expect it to bring you to.
* Interactive components include: color-changing homepage link, buttons linking to buy albums and merchandise, buttons linking to specific information pages, photo slideshows operated by the viewer, hover links on images.
* It is very useful, interesting and quite beautiful in my opinion. They have layed it out well and I feel like i could play around on it for significant amounts of time and still not fall uninterested.
* I would maybe add some video elements to give it more movement.

## Site 4
* https://www.lakemount.ca/
* It was one of my favourited links - accessed it straight from when i opened my browser.
* The design is fairly current - it has been updated within the last year. It's a take on the typical section by section site with featured images for each page. It uses good use of a theme color. The main page has a background looped video that showcases the highlights of the church to get people interested.
* The navigation is very easy to use. The home page is easily accessed by clicking the link attached to the logo at the top of the page. The main navigation is within a hamburger menu at the top right corner. Clicking it opens a list of links organized by category to make it easy to find what you are looking for.
* Interactive components include: header logo link to home page, hover-effect buttons to specific pages, hover-effect images, and a signup window at the bottom.
* I think it is very useful and user friendly. The bright orange captures your attention right away and the video header really gets you interested right away because you don't often see that on websites - its a newer thing by my knowledge.
* There are a couple spelling mistakes on some of the pages, so i would make sure those were checked over before publishing.

## Site 5
* http://art.yale.edu/
* I followed a link from an article because i was curious if it was still as bad as the article said it was. It is. Its just as bad.
* It is wayyyyy too busy. You don't know what you're looking at because of the quick moving tiled background that takes over the screen. The only information takes up a small box on the left side and you can't really focus long enough to read the information. What makes it worse is that the website is for YALE...
* The navigation is tucked away on the left side in a white box with what looks like a default font. The links turn the default blue with underline when you hover over them. It's not really user-friendly. 
* The only interactive parts are the menu headings and a few links under or beside photos promoting events.
* This site frustrates me and almost angers me to be honest. There doesn't look like there was any design thought put into laying it out to make it a functional website. I do find it humourous that they have a page called "about this site" where they address the many negative comments they have gotten on the site - explaining that the site is like a wiki - open to students to edit and change however and whenever.
* I think they could achieve the same random, artsy effect with a better organized look that pulls people into the randomness instead of pushing them away.
